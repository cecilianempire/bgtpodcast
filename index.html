     Broke Girl Therapy is a podcast hosted by Stefanie Maegan - a single girl looking for love in Los Angeles&hearts;. The show highlights intimate conversations she has with her family, close friends, ex boyfriends, and failed dates. Stefanie talks about problems she encounters trying to find her match in a challenging dating scene filled with gay men and shady f*ckboys. The show sheds light on the struggles that hard working single women face in the modern dating world. Steff hopes that fellow "broke girls" can relate to her shared stories and learn from her mistakes. She has realized throughout her journey that no matter what kind of guy you fall for - a woman should be career oriented, feel confident with themselves & comfortable with their sexuality.

      <p>Stefanie Maegan is an LA native and fashion guru. She started this podcast as a part-time passion project.
